WELCOME to the marvelous land of Labyrinth.py.

Labyrinth.py is a Doom-like escape labyrinth game. It is displayed in ASCII
so please be cautious. Thy quest is to find the exit.
Labyrinth.py is a self challenge about basic 3D viewing in text mode.

WARNINGS:
Labyrinth.py is only accessible to proud linux users since no testing of the
curses library has been done by the author.

IMPORTANT WARNINGS:   (press ctrl+C to quit if you do not comply)
*Labyrinth.py fiddles with keyboard repetition latency settings for smoother 
navigation. This affects ALL YOUR SYSTEM and will have undesired effects if 
you work on another program while having a labyrinth.py running. Also, do
not lock screen while game is on. You'd have hard time typing your password.
DO NOT KEEP A BACKGROUND WINDOW of labyrinth.py running.
*Labyrinth.py resets keyboard latency setting to default afterward. If for 
some reason your box does not use default keyboard latency settings, DO NOT 
run labyrinth.py on this box. 
*If for some reason Labyrinth.py did not give you back the default keyboard
latency setting, please copy and paste the following instruction in a bash
session to reset:
> xset r rate 660 25 

Keys:
Arrows to move			Q to quit		A/Z zoom level
P to print screen (to lab.screenshot.txt , which you can cat, obviously)

Advice: If you wish not to see that notice anymore, rename notice.txt to
any other filename.

Finally: Do not resize window while labyrinth is running. After this screen,
that is.
